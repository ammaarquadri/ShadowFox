## Overview
This project, completed as part of the Python Development Internship, involves analyzing a financial dataset using Python in a Jupyter notebook. The dataset includes key financial metrics such as net sales, profit, cost of goods sold (COGS), manufacturing costs, and freight costs.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**:
   - Performed an initial inspection of the dataset, reviewing data types, summary statistics, and identifying missing values.
   - Cleaned the data by removing any missing or incomplete entries to ensure accurate analysis.
   
2. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Temporal Trends**: Created line plots to visualize changes in net sales and profit over time.
   - **Cost Breakdown**: Used a stacked bar chart to compare the percentage breakdown of COGS, manufacturing costs, and freight costs.
   - **Relationship Analysis**: Implemented scatter plots to explore the relationship between manufacturing costs and net sales.
   - **Category Performance**: Bar charts were used to compare the financial performance of different product categories, focusing on total net sales and profit.

3. **Insights Derived**:
   - Identified key trends in sales and profitability over time.
   - Highlighted the proportion of various costs and their potential impact on net sales and profitability.
   - Discovered potential correlations between manufacturing costs and sales performance.
