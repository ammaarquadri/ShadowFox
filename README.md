Welcome to the repository for my Python Development Internship at **ShadowFox**! This repository contains the code and detailed documentation for the three tasks I completed during the program. Each task represents a unique aspect of Python development, including working with variables, building a web scraper, implementing a game, and conducting financial data analysis.

## 1. **Task 1: Core Python Concepts** 
### Overview
This task focuses on fundamental Python concepts such as variables, numbers, lists, if conditions, loops, and classes. Below are the key subtasks and challenges completed:

### Key Subtasks
- **Variables**: Stored values such as `pi`, experimented with reserved keywords.
- **Numbers**: Performed arithmetic operations like calculating simple interest, pond area, and speed.
- **List Operations**: Modified and organized the list of Justice League members.
- **Conditional Statements**: Created a BMI calculator and a city-country checker.
- **For Loops**: Simulated dice rolling and a workout program.
- **Dictionaries**: Calculated expenses and compared trip costs.
- **Classes & Objects**: Modeled Avengers characters using OOP concepts.
- **Inheritance**: Designed a `MobilePhone` base class with child classes for `Apple` and `Samsung`.

## 2. **Task 2: Web Scraper & Hangman Game Project**

### Overview
This project involves building a Web Scraper and a Hangman Game, both implemented in Python. The Web Scraper extracts data from web pages, while the Hangman Game challenges the player to guess a word with limited attempts.

### Key Features
- **Web Scraper**: Extracts data using Pythonâ€™s `BeautifulSoup` library, fetching data from the ShadowFox website for practice.
  - Data extraction and storage in CSV or JSON formats.
  - Implemented error handling for robustness.
  
- **Hangman Game**: A command-line game with visual feedback, offering random word selection and hints.
  - Ensures valid user input and tracks win/loss conditions.
  - Includes a "play again" option for continuous gameplay.

### Usage Instructions
1. **Web Scraper**: Install dependencies and run the scraper to fetch data from a target website.
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   python scraper.py
   ```

2. **Hangman Game**: Run the game directly from the terminal and try to guess the hidden word!
   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```

## 3. **Task 3: Financial Data Analysis Project**

### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a financial dataset using Python and Jupyter notebooks. The goal is to derive insights from the data, including trends in net sales and profitability, as well as the impact of costs.

### Key Steps
1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**: Reviewed data types, summary statistics, and cleaned the dataset for analysis.
2. **Data Visualization**: Used `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to visualize sales trends, cost breakdowns, and correlations.
3. **Insights**:
   - Temporal trends in sales and profits.
   - Proportion of costs and their influence on sales.
   - Relationship between manufacturing costs and net sales.

### Usage Instructions
- Open the Jupyter notebook file and run the analysis to explore financial data trends.

## Conclusion
Each task in this repository showcases different skills, from basic Python programming to more advanced topics like data scraping, game development, and financial analysis. This internship experience has been incredibly valuable for enhancing my Python development expertise.
